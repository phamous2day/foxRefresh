Refreshing the Fox Theater website for Mobile


## THE CHALLENGE

* Work as part of a design team. 
* Design a mobile experience for an Atlanta-based company. 
* Prioritize and design features that address usersâ€™ needs while satisfying the business prompt.  

## Approach/Strategy
* Heuristics analysis of current website to find any pain points, competitive analysis to find strengths and weaknesses of rivals.
* Screener survey to filter user testers, follow-up survey to get refined idea of user flow and pain points.
* Sketch and wireframes, rapid prototyping and user testing via Invision

## Insight/What I learned
Every stage of the UX process is important. In this project, identifying the pain points in the user flow revealed to us a simple flip in the ticket-purchasing process would increase sales and social aspect of the website. For example, the current setup is to select seat section first, then specify the amount of seats which makes a recursive problem for the user to keep going back and forth with those 2 screens to find seats that would accomodate a ticket-buyer's friends.

*Solution* To make seat selection first, _then_ specify the seat section which makes the user flow smoother and allow any matching algorithm to prioritize the amount of seats to choose seats by proximity rather than quantity.
